### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Karin, a screenwriter, copywriter, and frontend developer.
 <br />
I am always eager to find the best possible way to combine code engineering and creative thinking. 

<br />
I've worked in comedy for years, and am very passionate about a good laugh. Just like a briliant comic bit, in engineering there's a code you have to follow, but only by using the right props you'll make it exceptionally good.
 <br />
  <br />

I like to keep things fresh and exciting, , and am always up for a creative adventure.
